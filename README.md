# SMU .Hack - Introduction to API Development

> **Disclaimer:** This document is only meant to serve as a reference for the attendees of the workshop. It does not cover all the concepts or implementation details discussed during the actual workshop.

## Workshop Details
> This workshop will give you a brief introduction to web-based API development.

**Time**: Friday, 6 June 2025. 7:00pm - 10:00pm  
**Venue**: Singapore Management University @ 81 Victoria St, Singapore 188065

You will learn the fundamentals of deploying a REST API on a server running in the
cloud and automating the deployment using CI/CD pipelines. Next, you will be
understanding the various security mechanisms (Basic, Keys, Tokens, etc.) for securing
APIs and dive deep into OAuth2.0. Finally, we will wrap up with another important
concept called CORS when building web APIs.

In a hands-on exercise, you will be introduced to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (CI/CD platform) and [Railway](https://railway.app/) (Cloud Application Provider) will be used in conjunction to deploy the REST API in an automated fashion. Afterwards, in the second hands-on exercise, you will learn to implement OAuth2.0 with the FastAPI framework in Python.
